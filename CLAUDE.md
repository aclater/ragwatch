# ragwatch

Observability service for the rag-suite stack. Collects metrics from ragpipe, ragstuffer, and ragprobe and surfaces them via Prometheus + Grafana.

## Architecture
```
ragpipe ──→ metrics ──┐
                      ├──→ ragwatch (Prometheus) ──→ Grafana dashboards
ragstuffer ─→ metrics ─┤
                      │
ragprobe ──→ results ─┘
```

## Package structure
```
ragwatch/
  __init__.py      — empty (package marker)
tests/
  __init__.py      — empty (package marker)
quadlets/
  ragwatch.container         — Prometheus service quadlet (stub)
  ragwatch-grafana.container — Grafana dashboard quadlet (stub)
```

## Key design decisions
- Prometheus for metrics collection (pull-based, standard in cloud-native)
- Grafana for dashboards (rich visualization, alerting)
- Metrics scraped from ragpipe, ragstuffer, ragprobe endpoints
- No GPU required — pure metrics aggregation and visualization

## Running tests
```bash
pip install '.[dev]'
python -m pytest tests/ -v
ruff check && ruff format --check
```

## GPU acceleration

- This system may have an AMD, NVIDIA, or Intel GPU. All services and scripts must detect the available GPU at runtime and select the appropriate acceleration stack — do not hardcode a vendor.
- Detection priority: NVIDIA CUDA > AMD ROCm > Intel XPU/OpenVINO > CPU. Fall back to CPU only when no GPU is available, and log a clear warning when doing so.
- Never default to CPU for any workload that can run on GPU. CPU fallback is acceptable only when a specific library or operation has no GPU support, and must be explicitly noted in a comment explaining why.
- For Python workloads: use torch.cuda.is_available(), torch.version.hip (ROCm), or torch.xpu.is_available() (Intel) to detect and select the correct device at runtime. Do not hardcode "cuda", "rocm", or "cpu".
- For ONNX Runtime: select ExecutionProvider based on runtime detection — CUDAExecutionProvider, ROCMExecutionProvider, OpenVINOExecutionProvider, or CPUExecutionProvider — in that priority order.
- For container workloads:
  - NVIDIA: pass --device /dev/nvidia0 (or --gpus all with nvidia-container-toolkit)
  - AMD ROCm: pass --device /dev/kfd --device /dev/dri
  - Intel: pass --device /dev/dri
  - Document any container that cannot use GPU and why.
- AMD ROCm on gfx1151: HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION=11.5.1 is required. Set this env var in any quadlet, container, or script that uses ROCm on this hardware.
- Do not recommend or implement CPU-only solutions without first investigating whether a GPU-accelerated alternative exists for all three vendors.
- When benchmarking or profiling, always compare GPU vs CPU and report both. Never present CPU-only results as the baseline.
- When writing GPU detection code, always write it once as a shared utility function — do not duplicate vendor detection logic across files.


## Always verify current versions before using them

This is a hard requirement, not a suggestion. Using stale version numbers
wastes time, breaks builds, and has caused real incidents on this stack.

- BEFORE referencing any version number — for a container image, Python
  package, ROCm release, CUDA toolkit, npm package, system package, LLM
  model, or any other software — look it up. Do not use version numbers
  from training knowledge. They are outdated.
- For container images: check the registry (quay.io, ghcr.io,
  registry.access.redhat.com, docker.io) for the current stable tag
  before writing it. Verify the tag exists. Never use :latest in
  production quadlets.
- For Python packages: check PyPI for the current stable release
  before pinning.
- For ROCm: check https://rocm.docs.amd.com and
  https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm/releases for the current
  stable release. ROCm versions change frequently and using an old
  version is a primary cause of GPU acceleration failures on this stack.
- For CUDA: check https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads for the
  current stable release.
- For npm packages: check https://www.npmjs.com or run
  npm show <package> version.
- For LLM models: check Hugging Face and the model provider directly
  for current releases.
- For system packages (dnf/rpm/apt): do not pin versions unless
  explicitly asked — let the package manager resolve current stable.
- If you cannot verify a version, say so explicitly and ask.
  Do not guess. Do not use what you think the version is.


## Repository location

All code, projects, and repositories live exclusively under ~/git/.

- Never clone, create, or initialize a repository anywhere else on this
  system — not in ~/, not in /tmp, not in ~/Documents, or any other path.
- Before cloning or creating any repo, verify the target path is under
  ~/git/. If it is not, stop and correct the path.
- If you find a repository outside ~/git/, do not work in it. Move it
  to ~/git/ first, update any remotes if needed, and confirm the old
  location is removed before proceeding.
- When referencing local repos, always use ~/git/<reponame> as the path.


## User scripts and tools

User scripts and tools live in ~/.local/bin/, not ~/bin/.

- Always install scripts to ~/.local/bin/
- When referencing or running user scripts, always use ~/.local/bin/<script>
- Never create or reference scripts in ~/bin/ — that path is not used on
  this system


## Working directory conventions

All git repositories and working directories must follow this structure:

- `~/git/` — permanent repositories only. Clone repos here when you intend
  to work in them long-term. Never create temporary work here.
- `~/git-work/<task-name>/` — temporary clones for PR work. Create a
  subdirectory named after the task (e.g. ~/git-work/fix-qdrant-ipv6/).
  Clean up after the PR is merged.
- `~/.local/bin/` — user scripts and tools. Never use ~/bin/.
- Never create git-* directories directly in ~/. They clutter the home
  directory and never get cleaned up.

When starting any task that requires cloning repos:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/git-work/
cd ~/git-work/
gh repo clone aclater/
```

When the PR is merged, clean up:
```bash
rm -rf ~/git-work/
```

Or run the cleanup script periodically:
```bash
~/.local/bin/cleanup-git-work.sh --dry-run
~/.local/bin/cleanup-git-work.sh
```


## GitHub issue workflow

Every task must be tracked in GitHub before work begins. This is mandatory.

**Before starting any implementation task:**
1. Check if a GitHub issue exists for the work:
```bash
   gh issue list --repo aclater/ --search ""
```
2. If no issue exists, create one first:
```bash
   gh issue create \
     --repo aclater/ \
     --title "" \
     --body "" \
     --label "priority: ,type: ,agent: "
```
3. Note the issue number before proceeding.

**All commits must reference the issue:**
```
feat(ragpipe): add prometheus metrics endpoint (fixes #14)
fix(ragstuffer): deduplicate cited chunks in streaming path (refs #8)
```

**All PR bodies must include:**
- `Closes #N` — if the PR fully resolves the issue
- `Refs #N` — if the PR partially addresses the issue

**Never start implementation without an issue number.**
This ensures work is discoverable across parallel agent sessions
without requiring conversation history.
